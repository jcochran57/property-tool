    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 24, 2024</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Property Measurement Tool ("the App"). This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our free property measurement application.
    </p>
    
    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do NOT collect or store any personal information.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The App operates entirely in your web browser. All data you create (rooms, measurements, projects) is stored locally on your device only.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What We Do NOT Collect:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>Project data or measurements</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage tracking or analytics</li>
        <li>Cookies for tracking purposes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The App uses your browser's local storage to save your projects on your device. This data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stays on your device only</li>
        <li>Is never transmitted to our servers</li>
        <li>Can be deleted by clearing your browser data</li>
        <li>Is accessible only by this App on your device</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App is hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, which may collect minimal technical information for hosting purposes. Please refer to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank">GitHub's Privacy Policy</a> for more information.
    </p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device and we don't collect or transmit any data, your information is as secure as your device. We recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keeping your device secure with passwords/biometrics</li>
        <li>Regularly backing up important projects</li>
        <li>Using the Export function to save projects externally</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App is designed for professional use by insurance claims adjusters and property professionals. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
    </p>
    
    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since we don't collect any data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control over your project data stored locally on your device.
    </p>
    
    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top will indicate when changes were made. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
    
    <h2>9. Open Source</h2>
    <p>
        The App's source code is publicly available. You can review exactly how it works and verify that no data is collected or transmitted.
    </p>
